# Iptool
Task Overview: 


In this task, you will create a script called 'ip-tool' to explore IP range collisions in
our Kubernetes cluster. (This hypothetical scenario is created to make the task practically
understandable: kubenet will manage the IP networks in a basic Kubernetes cluster. Please
disregard this scenario for the purpose of the task.)
Main Task:* Default Function: The 'ip-tool' script should report the configured IP networks to a
container where the script is deployed. The output from this function should be collected from all
the containers in the cluster and concatenated together.* Collision Check: Using the '--check-
collision <file_path>' switch, the script should analyze the concatenated list of IP networks from the
entire clusterâ€™s output and return any colliding IP networks.Dockerfile Requirement: Provide a
Dockerfile that runs the script, returns the IP networks, and then stops.


Bonus Task: If you are
familiar with Kubernetes, create a Kubernetes deployment for the container running the 'ip-tool'
script.Expectations:


This task is designed to be quite easy, and we do not expect you to spend a lot of time on it.
However, we do expect production-grade code with proper requirement handling, acceptable test
coverage, clean code, and understandable git commit messages. You can use any open-source
libraries and any scripting language you like, but Python is preferred as we use it on a daily
basis
